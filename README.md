## Build Environment
- Written in Visual Studio Code
- Compiled with g++ 9.3.0
- Built with GNU Make 4.2.1
- Tested on Windows 10 WSLv2 Ubuntu 20.04

## Build Instructions
Built with Make on Linux using the included makefile.

To build, execute the `make` command in the Linux terminal. No additional options/arguments necessary.

### Project Overview
This program aims to emulate basic ARM Assembly language instructions with C++, specifically only the ADD, SUB, MUL, and DIV operations.
There should be sufficient modularity for future expansion/extension with a separate instruction loader/writer and dedicated ARM instruction class.
